 # Tudat
 #--------------------------------------

 # If Tudat is not found, use the following to manually set the path to the Tudat library.
#SET(TUDAT_BASE_PATH "C:/path/to/Tudat")

 # Enforce a rootpath for Tudat directory.
 # This should be used in case the FILE token does not given the full-path in the getRootPath() function in basicFunctions.h.
#add_definitions(-DTUDAT_CUSTOM_ROOT_PATH="C:/My/Custom/Path/To/Tudat")

 #--------------------------------------
 # Tudat Core
 #--------------------------------------

 # If Tudat Core is not found, use the following to manually set the path to the TudatCore library.
#SET(TUDAT_CORE_BASE_PATH "C:/path/to/TudatCore")

 # Enforce a rootpath for Tudat Core directory.
 # This should be used in case the FILE token does not given the full-path in the getRootPath() function in basicFunctions.h.
#add_definitions(-DTUDAT_CORE_CUSTOM_ROOT_PATH="C:/My/Custom/Path/To/TudatCore")

 #--------------------------------------
 # Boost
 #--------------------------------------

 # Set Boost paths manually:
 # If Boost is not found, use the following to manually set the path to the Boost include and library directories.
#SET(BOOST_ROOT       "C:/CWorkspace/tudatCore/trunk/boost")
#SET(BOOST_INCLUDEDIR "C:/path/to/boost")
 # Set the path to where your build libraries (*.a *.lib) are located
#SET(BOOST_LIBRARYDIR "C:/path/to/boost/stage/lib")

 # Additional boost debug settings, to check where things might be wrong:
 # Show details for every boost step performed:
#SET(Boost_DEBUG      "TRUE")
 # Give more detailed cmake boost error messages:
#SET(Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG "TRUE")

 # Set Boost variants to be used. The defaults in the CMakeLists.txt are STATIC_LIBS ON, MULTITHREADED ON and STATIC_RUNTIME ON.
#SET(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)
#SET(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED ON)
#SET(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME ON)

 #--------------------------------------
 # Eigen 3
 #--------------------------------------

 # If Eigen3 is not found, use the following to manually set the path to the Eigen3 directory.
#SET(EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR "C:/path/to/eigen3")          # Set to the path where you extracted eigen3

 #--------------------------------------
 # Other CMakeSettings
 #--------------------------------------

 # Force build in debug or release mode.
#SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)
#SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release)

 # Manually set lib and bin directories.
#SET(LIBROOT "C:/path/to/lib")
#SET(BINROOT "C:/path/to/bin")
